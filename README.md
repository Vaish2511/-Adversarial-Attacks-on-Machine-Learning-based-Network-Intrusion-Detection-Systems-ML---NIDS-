# Adversarial-Attacks-on-Machine-Learning-based-Network-Intrusion-Detection-Systems-ML-NIDS

## Description:
Investigated adversarial vulnerabilities in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) by designing 20+ attack methodologies, including model extraction, ensemble poisoning, and novel adaptive confidence poisoning. Used advanced techniques like FGSM and PGD to reduce model accuracy from 81% to 16.88%, simulating real-world adversarial threats.

## Key Features:
1. Adversarial Attack Methodologies: Designed and executed over 20 advanced attack strategies like shadow model attacks, model extraction, and ensemble poisoning.
2. Gray-box Attack Modeling: Simulated realistic adversarial scenarios on time-series data to test the resilience of NIDS.
3. Optimization-Based Attacks: Utilized techniques like Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to evaluate model vulnerabilities.

## Data Source:
Raw Network Packets from the Cyber Range Lab of the Australian Center for Cybersecurity (ACCS). This dataset has nine types of attacks, namely, Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode and Worms. 

## Techonology Used:
1. Python
2. Machine Learning Libraries (E.g., TensorFlow, Sci-Kit)
3. Data Processing Libraries (E.g., Pandas, Numpy)

## Target Audience:
1. Cybersecurity researchers and professionals focused on improving the robustness of intrusion detection systems.
2. Developers working on deploying secure, adaptive, and resilient NIDS solutions in real-time environments.
3. Organizations and enterprises that rely on NIDS to safeguard critical networks from emerging threats.

## Why it Matters: 
In an increasingly digital world, Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are vital for detecting and mitigating cyberattacks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks compromises their reliability. By investigating these vulnerabilities and developing robust attack strategies, this research enhances the security of NIDS, ensuring they remain effective against evolving threats and safeguarding sensitive data in critical networks.
