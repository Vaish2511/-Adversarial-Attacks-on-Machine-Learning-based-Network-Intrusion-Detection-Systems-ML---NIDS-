# -Adversarial-Attacks-on-Machine-Learning-based-Network-Intrusion-Detection-Systems-ML---NIDS-
Investigated adversarial vulnerabilities in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) by designing 20+ attack methodologies, including model extraction, ensemble poisoning, and novel adaptive confidence poisoning. Used advanced techniques like FGSM and PGD to reduce model accuracy from 81% to 16.88%, simulating real-world adversarial threats.
